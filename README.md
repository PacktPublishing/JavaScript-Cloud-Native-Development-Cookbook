**Deliver serverless cloud-native solutions on AWS, Azure, and GCP**

## What is this book about?
Cloud-native development is a modern approach to building and running applications that leverage the merits of the cloud computing model. With cloud-native development, teams can deliver faster and in a more lean and agile way than traditional approaches. This recipe-based guide provides you quick solutions for your cloud-native applications.
This book covers the following exciting features:
* Implement patterns such as Event Streaming, CQRS, and Event Sourcing
* Deploy multi-regional, multi-master solutions
* Secure your cloud-native services with OAuth and OpenID Connect
* Create a robust cloud-native continuous deployment pipeline
* Run services on AWS, Azure, and GCP
* Implement autonomous services to limit the impact of failures

The code will look like the following:
```
module.exports.hello = (event, context, callback) => {
  console.log('event: %j', event);
  console.log('env: %j', process.env);
  callback(null, 'success');
};
```
